## Features of Shokuin

I currently plan to add these features:

- **Expiration Sorting:** Automatically sort your inventory by expiry date.  
- **Barcode Scanning:** Android companion app with predictive expiry lookup.  
- **Food Details API:** Fetch nutritional info and images from free public APIs.

## What does Shokuin mean?

It is a simple word play of 「食」(shoku) meaning food and 「イン」(in) being a non-traditional shortening of inventory or 「インベ」(inbe).
